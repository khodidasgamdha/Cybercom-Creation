                            <h2>To our Valued Customers</h2>
                            <p>Like so many of you, we have spent the last several days and weeks learning about the coronavirus
                                (COVID-19) and how it is impacting our world. For 1StopBedrooms, that means understanding how it
                                affects our employees, customers and communities, and then making the necessary adjustments to
                                our work and operations.</p>
                            <p>
                                We have one simple objective that guides us: keeping you and our employees safe. This has been
                                at the center of our conversations every step of the way. With that in mind, we have made
                                several moves in our business in response to the threat of the coronavirus.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We are diligently following guidance and best practices from the Centers for Disease Control
                                    and Prevention (CDC).</li>
                                <li>Across all of our facilities and delivery operations, we have increased our daily cleaning
                                    routines, including more frequent hand washing, use of sanitizer, and cleaning of equipment.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We know that many of you have scheduled in-home deliveries, installations or repairs with us. If
                                you have any concerns, we will be happy to reschedule your appointment at no additional cost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In high impacted areas local health departments are recommending threshold deliveries only. This
                                means we will deliver to your front door or entryway. In these locations all in home setup will
                                temporarily be suspended. Once your delivery is ready to be scheduled you will have the option
                                to accept a threshold delivery or wait and get notified as soon as white glove service is
                                restored. Should you choose to wait for white glove service to be restored your order will be
                                held at the delivery carrier at no charge to you.</p>
                            <p>
                                We know that this change will be inconvenient, and we are truly sorry. It was made with our
                                employees’ and your best interests at heart. </p>
                            <p>
                                We will continue to closely monitor the situation and do all we can to protect you and our
                                employees.</p>

                                    shipping and handling fees or oversize charges at the end of the checkout process. Make sure
                                    to check what type of delivery service is being offered. Many companies offer free delivery
                                    which is curb side or threshold and just leave the heavy furniture at your curb or door and
                                    expect you to lug the furniture inside yourselves. Our professional delivery team will carry
                                    the heavy furniture inside for you. Make sure you know the total cost of your purchase when

                        <p>Online purchases are subject to applicable sales taxes. The sales tax for your order is based on
                            state and local tax rates as well as the shipping and/or service location of your order. Gift cards
                            are not taxable but purchases made with gift cards are subject to applicable sales taxes.</p>
                        <p>
                            We collect sales tax on sales made to all state and local jurisdictions. For purchases where sales
                            tax is applicable. Tax shown at checkout is an estimate and the actual tax collected may differ once
                            we process the order.</p>
                        <p>
                            Factors such as the type of item or service purchased, the time and location of fulfillment, the
                            shipment or delivery address of your order can change between the time you place an order and when
                            your shipment is complete. As a result, the tax calculated on your order may change. We provide an
                            "Estimated Tax" displayed at Check Out when confirming an order. The amounts displayed as estimated
                            tax may then be updated later when your order is finalized and completed. The tax rate applied to
                            your order will be the combined state and local rates of the address where your order is delivered
                            to or fulfilled from. For example, if you live in a state that does not impose a sales tax, you may
                            still see tax calculated on your order if shipped to another state. </p>
                        <p>
                            We use reasonable commercial efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on
                            each taxable purchase, but we do not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax we represent to
                            you as the tax owed. Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple
                            taxing districts, state and local “tax holidays,” the timing of rate changes or the application of
                            certain taxes to categories of items we sell. As a result of any error, we may over collect or under
                            collect your tax. In consideration of our allowing you access to and use of the Site, and in
                            collecting and remitting taxes required on your purchases, you hereby waive your right to claim that
                            the tax collected on any purchase is incorrect in any respect and agree to hold us harmless, our
                            officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, for any harm or other damages you may
                            incur as a result of our error in calculating the taxes you owe for your purchases.</p>
