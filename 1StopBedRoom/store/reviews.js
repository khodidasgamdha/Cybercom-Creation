      description: 'I bought 6 dining chairs from Ashley Homestore. When I decided to go with a larger dining room table, I went back to Ashley for 2 more chairs only to find my chairs had been discontinued! I was desperate to find these chairs. By chance, I stumbled upon 1stopbedroom while doing a google search. I called and immediately got someone to help me. He was very pleasant. He informed me there were only 2 sets of chairs left, and if I wanted them I\'d need to act fast and waive my free cancellation within 24 hours. I jumped on it and ordered one of the remaining sets with the rep. After I ordered with the pleasant man (I wish I remembered his name), I started to read reviews for 1stopbedroom and I became very very nervous. I found some good reviews, but also some pretty terrible ones! My heart sank, and I just resolved to believing it was too good to be true and not only would I not get my chairs for several months if at all, but I was probably out of about $350. Well, to my surprise, my chairs arrived 8 days after I initially called 1stopbedroom!! They came in perfect condition! (The box was beat up but the chairs were perfect). They are the exact match to the 6 I already had! They were also extremely easy to assemble-just had to put the legs on. I was so stunned at how easy of a process it was, especially after reading some other peoole\'s experiences with lost packages, waiting for months for their orders, and not being able to get customer service on the phone. I don\'t know if it was a fluke, but I had an excellent experience!',

      description: 'I cannot say enough good things about 1stopbedrooms. From the first minute of contact with their sales department, Vera was BEYOND amazing at providing service. She helped pick the furniture, confirmed that it would fit appropriately, confirmed the layout of the dining room and made mattress suggestions, and then sent an update for each step of the order. There were no surprises which is amazing. Then came the actual delivery: I have never been so impressed with delivery, set up, and speed. It was perfect.. I didn\'t have to touch or rearrange anything. It came as scheduled, with the guys even calling me 30 minutes prior to arrival like I asked. The whole thing took 20 minutes - for an entire dining room set and bedroom set to get delivered and set up. PHENOMENAL! Vera even followed up with me the day of the delivery to make sure that all my expectations were met. Can\'t beat the price or the service!',

I struggled with them until my son in law came over. Walks in delivery today for 1 Stop bedrooms. They truly had white gloves on; they did everything for me. Didn\'t have to do anything. Personable, courteous, skilled. Knew what they were doing. Thanks guys, you did a great job & I didn\'t have to pay an arm & leg for it. And did I mention good quality furniture? Very satisfied with all. Thanks! Jaw',
